**Wa**ve**f**unction Solv**er**: a parallelized, 3D, Schrödinger equation solver.

Wa*f*er exploits a Wick-rotated time-dependent Schrödinger equation to solve for time-independent solutions in three dimensions.

Inspired by [quantumfdtd](http://sourceforge.net/projects/quantumfdtd/), and is still quite a work in progress, but aims to be a general purpose utility.

If you use Wa*f*er in your research, please reference the following articles:
